		<p>Since we'reall sick of talking about red states vs. bue states, let's take a break<br/>and switch to a different metric. How about book states vs. mobile states? Or<br/>dance states vs. museum states?</p>
		<p>Those sort of breakdowns are found in a pair of studies just realeased by the<br/><a href="https://www.arts.gov/">National Endowment for the Arts</a>, wich track participation in the arts on<br/>both the national and state level. Though the research includes some fun<br/>findings, it also confirms at least one troubling trend: We're increasingly less<br/>likely to read literature.</p>
		<p>According to the NEA, the share of adults who report reading literature has<br/>steadily fallen in recent years, from 47 percent in 2012 to 45 percent n 2013<br/>and 43.1 percent in 2015</p>
